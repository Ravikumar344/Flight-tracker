# Flight-tracker
A flight tracker is a technology-driven system designed to monitor and provide real-time information about the status and location of commercial flights, private planes, and other aircraft. It leverages a combination of data sources, including radar systems, satellite communication, and various sensors, to collect and disseminate accurate and up-to-date flight-related information to users.

Flight trackers are commonly utilized by aviation professionals, airline companies, airport staff, air traffic controllers, and passengers to gain insights into flight schedules, routes, departure and arrival times, delays, altitude, speed, and even the current position of aircraft. This technology has greatly enhanced the efficiency and safety of air travel, as it allows for better coordination between different stakeholders involved in aviation operations.

For passengers and enthusiasts, flight tracking applications and websites offer the ability to follow the progress of specific flights in real-time, providing an engaging and informative experience. These platforms often display detailed flight data and visuals, such as maps, aircraft types, departure and destination airports, flight paths, and even weather conditions along the route.

Overall, flight tracking systems play a crucial role in modern aviation by enhancing operational efficiency, safety, and transparency for both professionals and the general public, contributing to a smoother and more informed travel experience.

Creating a flight tracker project in Python can be an exciting and educational endeavor. In this example, I'll provide you with a simple outline and code snippets to get you started on building a basic flight tracker using Python.

# Project Outline: Flight Tracker in Python

Collect Flight Data:

Retrieve flight data from a reliable source (API or dataset).
Extract relevant information like flight number, departure airport, arrival airport, scheduled departure time, etc.
Real-time Updates:

Implement a loop to regularly fetch updated data from the source.
Compare new data with previous data to identify changes (e.g., delays, route changes).
Display Information:

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to display flight information.
Update the GUI with real-time data changes.
Map Visualization (Optional):

Integrate a map library to show the flight's current position and route.
Plot the flight's trajectory based on collected data.
User Interaction (Optional):

Allow users to input a flight number and track specific flights.
Provide options to filter and sort flights based on different criteria.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to gracefully handle data retrieval and processing issues.
Display appropriate error messages to users.
